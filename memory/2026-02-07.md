## 07:37 Git Merge & Security Fix
- Merged `feature/board-slider-v3` to `main` per David's request
- **SECURITY:** Found exposed OpenAI API key in MODEL-ROUTING.md (commit 7c489e3)
- Rewrote git history with `git filter-branch` to remove the secret
- Force pushed to GitHub - repo now at `ClarkSterling/Sterlings` (moved from youshiftbro)
- ⚠️ Told David to rotate the key at platform.openai.com/api-keys

## 07:41 Email Capability Added
- David updated my rules: Can now email him at david@speedcapital.co.uk (only him, no one else)
- Updated TOOLS.md with new email rule
- Successfully sent test email via Gmail browser (API key rotation instructions)

## 07:46 Email CLI Setup (In Progress)
- Installed `msmtp` via Homebrew for command-line email
- Created config at `~/.msmtprc` (needs app password)
- **BLOCKED:** Waiting for David to generate Gmail App Password at myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

## 04:20-07:47 Heartbeat Checks
- All apps healthy: Mission Control (3001), Bean Counter (3002), Clark's Beat (3003), Proving Ground (3000)
- 1 task in Spec: #28 "Add Hotwire for invoice builder" (unassigned, not urgent)
- No sub-agent work pending

## Key Learnings
- Use Gmail compose URL with params for reliable browser email: `?view=cm&fs=1&to=X&su=Y&body=Z`
- `git filter-branch` can rewrite history to remove secrets before push
