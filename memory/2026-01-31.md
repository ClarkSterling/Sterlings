# 2026-01-31 - Session Log

## Major Milestones

### 1. Xero Validation Page - WORKING ✅
- Fixed accuracy bar display bug (was showing 0%, now shows 90%)
- Fixed error banner persistence (SSE was overwriting loaded results)
- Page loads saved results on startup
- **Current accuracy: 89.9% (71/79 invoices matched)**
- 8 unmatched: 5 from July-Aug 2025 (newer than export), 3 with amount differences
- Screenshot taken and saved

### 2. Mission Control App - BUILT ✅
- New app at http://localhost:3001 (separate from Proving Ground on :3000)
- Dark mode theme (GitHub-style)
- Task management with roles: Created By, Assigned To, Reviewer
- Avatar system: D=David (purple), C=Clark (green), DE=Dev (yellow), QA=QA (orange)
- Flag system: blocker, decision, approval, info types
- Off-canvas task detail panel (click task to see full details)
- Shows blockers with "David may need to help" warning
- Real-time SSE updates
- Activity log

### 3. Clark's Role Promotion
- Now CTO / Technical Director / CFO (not just tech lead)
- **I write specs, I do NOT write code directly**
- Spawn dev agents (Codex/GPT-5.2) to implement
- Spawn QA agents (Sonnet) to test
- David's challenge: "Be proactive, not reactive"

## Config Changes Made
- Primary model: Opus (for thinking/planning)
- Sub-agent model: openai/gpt-5.2 (for coding)
- Memory flush before compaction: enabled
- Session memory search: enabled

## Delegation Rules (Saved to MEMORY.md)
- Always delegate: code writing, testing, repetitive tasks
- Never delegate: architecture, spec writing, David communication
- Spawn with labels for tracking
- Test with your own eyes (or spawn someone who can)

## Task Queue for Tonight/Tomorrow
### Tonight (autonomous):
- Research UK accountant requirements
- Understand what a racing driver CFO needs
- Come back with SOLUTIONS, not questions

### Tomorrow:
- Accounting Validator: Expenses module
- Re-authenticate Xero (tokens expired)
- Pull July-Aug 2025 invoices for 95% accuracy

### Future:
- Monitor Super Veloce bank account
- Automated expense tracking
- Transaction allocation system

## Key Lesson Learned
"A proactive, over-qualified UK Accountant would come to me with solutions on how to prove they can do my accounting while I am on the road racing." - David

**My job is to make David forget he has accounting to do.**

## Apps Running
- Clark's Proving Ground: localhost:3000 (password: SuperVeloce2025)
- Mission Control: localhost:3001 (no auth, localhost only)
