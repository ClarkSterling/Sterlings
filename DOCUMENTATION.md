# DOCUMENTATION.md - Documentation Organization

*Where and how to save documented work for David*

## Default Documentation Location

**All documented work should be saved in:** `~/Documents/`

**NOT in workspace** unless it's temporary/working files.

---

## Folder Structure

Use clean, organized folder structures based on topic/project:

```
~/Documents/
├── Accounting/
│   ├── Super Veloce Test/          ← Current project
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY-DAVID.md
│   │   ├── RECONCILIATION-REPORT.md
│   │   └── ...
│   └── Speed Capital/              ← Future
│       └── ...
├── Projects/
│   └── [project-specific folders]
├── Research/
│   └── [topic-specific folders]
└── ...
```

## Best Practices

### Folder Naming
- **Clear & descriptive:** "Super Veloce Test" not "test123"
- **Topic-based hierarchy:** Accounting/Company/Project
- **Use spaces:** "Super Veloce Test" not "super-veloce-test"
- **Title case:** "Super Veloce Test" not "super veloce test"

### File Naming
- **Descriptive:** `EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY-DAVID.md` not `summary.md`
- **Uppercase for important docs:** `README.md`, `EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY-DAVID.md`
- **Dates when relevant:** `2026-01-31-test-results.md`
- **No spaces in filenames:** Use hyphens or CamelCase

### Always Include
- **README.md** in every folder explaining:
  - What this folder contains
  - Date and context
  - Key findings/results
  - File descriptions
  - Next steps

### File Types
- **Reports:** Markdown (.md) for readability
- **Data:** JSON for structured data, CSV for imports
- **Export copies:** Keep both JSON (full) and CSV (import-ready) versions

## Workflow

When completing any documented work:

1. **Determine topic/category** (Accounting, Projects, Research, etc.)
2. **Create appropriate subfolder** if needed
3. **Copy/save all relevant files** to that location
4. **Create README.md** explaining what's there
5. **Tell David the path** so he knows where to find it

## Current Active Folders

### Accounting/Super Veloce Test
- Clark's Proving Ground test results
- Created: January 31, 2026
- Status: Active (pending Xero MFA setup)

---

## Why This Matters

- David's Documents folder is his permanent archive
- Workspace can be messy/temporary
- Clean structure = easy to find later
- README files = context for future reference
- Professional organization for when sharing with others
