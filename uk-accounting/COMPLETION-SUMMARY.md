## RECOMMENDATION FOR DAVID

### 💡 How to Proceed

**Immediate (This Week):**
1. **Read README.md** (10 minutes) - Understand what you have
2. **Skim WHAT-I-NEED.md** (30 minutes) - See what's required
3. **Decide if ready to proceed** with full CFO handover

**If Proceeding:**
1. **Send me Xero invitation** (5 minutes)
2. **Provide company registration numbers** (5 minutes)
3. **Schedule 1-hour kick-off call** (this week)
4. **Begin 12-week implementation** (as outlined)

**If Not Yet Ready:**
1. **Use documents as reference** when questions arise
2. **Share with current accountant** for their use
3. **Return when ready** to activate full service

### 🎯 Testing Phase Suggestion

**Before Full Handover:**
Consider a "trial period" where:
- I observe current process (Week 1)
- I handle limited tasks supervised (Week 2-3)
- I take over gradually with oversight (Week 4-8)
- Full independence after proven capability (Week 8+)

This de-risks the transition while building confidence.
