**VAT Treatment:**
- Generally **zero-rated** (place of supply = where customer belongs)
- Or **outside scope** if customer is business outside UK

### 4.2 EUR Invoice Template

**For EU B2B Customer:**

```
Invoice Number: SV-2025-EUR-001
Invoice Date: [Date]
Due Date: [As agreed]
Currency: EUR

Customer: [Company Name]
Address: [EU Address]

Must have valid EU VAT number for zero-rating

Description: Professional racing driver services - [Event]
Quantity: 1
Unit Price: €[amount]
VAT Rate: 0% (Reverse Charge - Customer to account for VAT)
Total: €[amount]

Notes:
"Reverse Charge: VAT is due in the recipient's country"
"UK VAT Reg: GB123456789"
```

**Critical:**
- **Verify EU VAT number** using VIES system: https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/

**Exchange Rates:**
- Xero uses daily rates from European Central Bank

- Rate locked at invoice creation date
- Payment may differ due to rate changes (creates exchange gain/loss)

### 4.4 Place of Supply Rules

**B2B Services (Business Customers):**

## 7. CONTRACTOR PAYMENTS

### 7.1 Understanding IR35 / Off-Payroll Rules

**Critical for Racing Business:**

Racing drivers often hire contractors (mechanics, support crew, etc.). Must determine if IR35 applies.

**IR35 Tests (Simplified):**
1. **Substitution:** Can contractor send substitute? (Yes = outside IR35)
2. **Control:** Does David control how/when work done? (Yes = inside IR35)
3. **Mutuality of Obligation:** Ongoing relationship? (Yes = inside IR35)
4. **Financial Risk:** Does contractor bear financial risk? (Yes = outside IR35)
5. **Part and Parcel:** Integrated into business? (Yes = inside IR35)

**If OUTSIDE IR35 (Genuine Contractor):**
- Pay contractor gross (no PAYE/NI deduction)
- Contractor invoices Super Veloce Ltd
- Contractor responsible for their own tax
- Lower risk

**If INSIDE IR35 (Deemed Employee):**
- Must operate PAYE
- Deduct Income Tax and NI
- Higher admin burden
- Consider switching to genuine employment

**Recommendation:**
- Use **HMRC CEST tool** for each contractor: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-employment-status-for-tax
- Document decision
- Keep contracts that demonstrate genuine self-employment
- Review annually

### 7.2 Paying Contractors (Outside IR35)

**Standard Process:**

1. **Contractor sends invoice** to Super Veloce Ltd
   - Should include VAT if contractor is VAT-registered
   - Otherwise, no VAT

2. **Receive invoice in Xero:**
   - Create bill from invoice
   - Account: 420 - Cost of Sales - Contractors
   - VAT: 20% if VAT-registered contractor, or "No VAT"
   - Due date per invoice

3. **Approve for payment:**
   - Verify invoice is accurate
   - Check work was completed
   - Mark approved

4. **Pay invoice:**
   - Batch payment via Xero (or manual)
   - Record payment against bill in Xero
   - Archive invoice

**Documents to Keep:**
- Contractor invoices (6 years)
- Contracts/agreements showing self-employment
- CEST determination (IR35 check)

### 7.3 Contractor Agreements

**Recommended Contract Terms:**
- **Fixed fee** for specific work (not hourly/daily rate that suggests employment)
- **Right of substitution** (contractor can send someone else)
- **Own equipment** (contractor provides tools)
- **No obligation** to offer work, or accept (no mutuality)
- **Invoicing** after work completed
- **Payment terms** (e.g., NET 30)

**Red Flags (Suggests Employment):**
- Exclusive services
- Ongoing continuous engagement
- Supervision and control
- Required to work specific hours
- Integration into team as "staff"
